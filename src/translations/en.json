    "set_address": "Configures the user's address for checking outage schedules. Address is saved and used for all subsequent requests. Important: city and street must have correct prefixes (м., Просп., Вул., etc.) as they appear in DTEK autocomplete. Can be run this way: 'Set address м. Дніпро, вул. . Вʼячеслава Липинського, буд. 4'.",
    "check_outage_schedule": "Checks electricity outage schedule for configured address. Always fetches both accurate schedule for today/tomorrow (ACTUAL) and weekly forecast (POSSIBLE_WEEK) from DTEK website. Parameter include_possible controls whether to show forecast in output. Make sure address is configured via set_address first. Can be run this way: 'Check electricity outage schedule for today (with time when we have electricity too)'.",
    "get_next_outage": "Finds the next upcoming electricity outage from accurate schedule (ACTUAL). Shows when and for how long the outage is scheduled. Works only with accurate schedule for today/tomorrow.",
    "get_outages_for_day": "Gets all outages for specific day of week. Can retrieve both accurate schedule (ACTUAL) for today/tomorrow and forecast (POSSIBLE_WEEK).",
    "configure_monitoring": "Configures monitoring and notification settings. Automatically sets up background monitoring (cron job/LaunchAgent) when enabled. Set how many minutes before outage to notify, enable/disable notifications, and configure check interval. Everything is automatic - no manual setup required!",
    "check_upcoming_outages": "Checks for upcoming outages based on configured notification settings. Returns notification if outage is approaching within configured time window. Use this to get proactive alerts about upcoming power cuts.",
    "calculate_charging_time": "🪄 MAGIC! Automatically reads your MacBook battery status and tells you exactly when to plug in to reach 80%/100% charge right before the next power outage. Works in Docker too via battery_info.sh bridge script. No manual input needed - just run it!"
